# Better than open source contributions

## Intro

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a show about learning the Rust programming language. This is *Bonus Episode 5: Better Than Open Source Contributions*.

## News and Follow-up

First, a quick explanation on the delay of this episode: we had a family health emergency come up---the kind that landed a family member in the hospital for several days---so recording this obviously took a lower priority. Podcasts are good and Rust is great, but family is far, *far more important*. As you'll see in a minute, that's actually especially fitting given the content of this particular bonus episode.

One of the big highlights for me in the last couple weeks is the announcement of the open-source Xi editor project, which aims to be a performant, extensible editor with a Rust text engine backing it and native interfaces in Cocoa and eventually .NET, GTK, etc. This is incredibly interesting to me for a variety of reasons, some them algorithmic (like the fascinating *ropes* algorithm he's using to implement the text engine; and others architectural, like the planned structure for linking the front and back ends; and of course some simply Rustic: this is *exactly* the kind of thing I've long had in mind to use Rust for, and the reason I started learning it in the first place. I'll link the project in the show notes, and you should definitely keep an eye on it.

One other thing to check out: for Rust's 1.0's one-year birthday, the Rust team launched a community survey. I've linked it in the show notes, so go fill it out!


## Open source

Now, for today's topic. Over the last few years, I've often seen the suggestion that you need to be actively involved with open source software for the sake of your career. Last week, I saw someone say flat-out that he won't hire someone who doesn't do a bunch of open-source work in their spare time.

This is, in a word, *nonsense*.

To start with, I don't really buy the argument that it's somehow a mark of a good developer. I've had several jobs where it wouldn't have been remotely relevant---and for the job I have now, which is an absolute dream in many ways, I don't have any reason to believe the meager open source contributions I *had* made impacted the hiring decision whatsoever. And that's as it should be, because I think it would actually be a disaster if most companies started treating open-source contributions as a major component of a hiring decision. Or, for that matter, *any* component, for the vast majority of jobs. (The only exception is a job where you're being hired to work *on* open-source. But those are pretty rare.)

Why does this even come up? Well, employers tend to care about open-source contributions on your resume for a couple reasons.

1. **They see it as a way to evaluate your code quality.** This is a reasonable desire, but there are lots of ways to do this which don't involve requiring open source work. One of my favorites, an idea o picked up from The Frontside, is for a company to hire you at their standard consulting rate for a day and just work with you directly. This gives you a good feel for the company, gives the people at the company a good feel for where your skills really are and how you work with a team, and---incredibly importantly---doesn't ask you to do something for free to prove your value as an employee.
2. **They see it as a sign that you're the kind of employee they want to hire, because they want people who do a lot of programming outside of work.** From companies like this, just run away. Basically, this means two things about the company in question:
	1. They do not value anything about you except your programming interest. As I'll come back to in a minute, this is a profoundly misguided view of what makes for a healthy employee---because it's a profoundly misguided view of what makes a healthy *human*.
	2. It drives the company toward a monoculture, and means it will miss out on a lot of other wake vey qualified and talented people, whose input and perspectives will be enormously enriching. While diversity can become a sort of totem, something people chase for its own sake, I think a wide variety of perspectives really is quite good for the work we all do. More than that, though: do you really want to work at (or be) the kind of company that turns down a programmer just because she's a mom who thinks spending time helping her kids with their homework in the evening is more valuable than doing open source software? Or because he's a son whose parents are ill and he takes care of them? Or because she's spending nights and evenings investing in community theater? Or any number of other legitimate, healthy, human reasons people have to do something besides *code* in their spare time?

Don't get me wrong. I like doing software work for fun. I make a podcast about a programming language, for goodness' sake. But demanding that everyone fit that mold is incredibly shortsighted; it will make you build a pretty terrible company culture filled with people who are just clones of you. And it inherently devalues everything else. At the end of the day, you don't want to work for a company that's incapable of seeing things besides software as valuable. If "you must do open source" is one of their prerequisites, keep applying for other software jobs. There are more than enough to go around.

But let's take this one step further: even the "we want you to have other hobbies" line you sometimes hear can be a problem. Some companies want you to have outside activities and not sell yourself to the job for reasons that are still, at the end of the day, purely mercenary. It's increasingly well-known that people are more productive on the job when they have healthy personal lives, so it's understandable that well-informed companies are starting to value that. But I think that, while that shift is good in one way, in too many cases it still comes down to a commoditization of people. In a way, it's worse than the more directly exploitative practices it replaces: it says that families and non-work hobbies are valuable not because they're good, essential parts of human existence as it is supposed to be, but merely as more means to the end of profit. And human beings and human relationships are not means, but ends in and of themselves. When we turn people's entire lives and all their loves into nothing more than another way to maximize productivity and profit, we have gotten things completely backwards.

Now of course it *does* help, but that's because people are meant for more than work! We are not meant for less: work is good. Programming is good. Creating things and putting them into the world is good. But those things aren't everything, and we should never, *ever* make everything about them.

Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful that my employer is quite serious about people taking care of their families and leaving work at work. And if you're running a business or managing a product team, you will probably find that people do give you better work when you encourage them to do things besides programming. But don't make the mistake of reducing people to levers for profit. And if you're an employee, don't make the mistake of letting someone demand that you make your life about the job---not directly and not indirectly. Be okay interrogating the way companies think as well as what they do, because *it matters*. It *really* matters. The best kinds of companies want you to spend time with your family and have things you're passionate about outside of work not just because it's good business, but because it's simply *good*.


## Closing

In some ways, as much as I love talking about Rust---and as happy as I'll be to hop back into that next time---I think it's worth stopping to say things like this. Thanks for listening, and if you found this episode helpful, do please share it with friends or colleagues.
