Building as a Community
=======================

Intro (30s -> 0:30)
-----
Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a show about
learning the Rust programming language. This is **Bonus Episode 3: Building as a
Community**.

Normal episodes are 15--20 minutes long, but bonus episodes like this one are a
bit shorter---usually under 10 minutes. I took a one-week long 8--5-every-day
class three weeks ago, and then started a new job two weeks ago, which included
getting trapped in New York City by a once-a-century blizzard, so I have not had
time to put together quite as technical a talk as usual. But today's topic,
community, is just as important for whether Rust succeeds in the long term---
maybe even more important---than some of the technical details we talk about
week in and week out.


Talk (6-8m)
----

  - **A story (2m):** learning Fortran
  - **Another story (2m):** learning Rust
  - **Takeaways (4m):**

     1. Community matters even for building something big and complicated, and
        you don't have to be a jerk to get really amazing results. Quite the
        opposite, in fact. (elaborate: Rust, Elixir, etc.``)

     2. Building *as* a community matters as well. It's great that we're kind to
        each other---really great. But we should also actively help each other.
        This is true of any project you want to succeed. You'd be surprised how
        much open-source projects need help, and how often you're actually one
        of the best people *to* help. If you see a problem, you are often in the
        best position to fix it simply because you know the pain point.

        And if you have a good community, like we do in Rust, people will help
        you help them. Ask around, look at lists of issues, etc.---and even if
        an issue marked "easy" looks too daunting, give it a go. Find a project
        that looks interesting, or useful, and offer to help. People will help
        you learn what you need to know to solve that problem. You'll grow, the
        project will be in better shape, and it'll be a win all around.


Closing (1m 30s -> TODO)
-------
Next time, we're going to go for a high-level but extremely important discussion
about type systems, both in general and specifically in Rust. Since Rust's type
system is such a big part of its interest, and one of a few things that
distinguishes it from languages like C or Java, I think it'll be fun and
interesting to talk about that in a bit more detail.
