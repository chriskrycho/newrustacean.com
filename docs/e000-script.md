"Hello! I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute show about learning the Rust programming language."

  - Usual show format, this episode format (3 minutes)
      + Usual: any important news or follow-up (<5 minutes), then one or two
        topics of interest from what I've been learning, always with code
        samples available on the site and GitHub. It will be roughly weekly, but
        life does happen occasionally!
        
        I'm going to assume a basic working knowledge of programming, and along
        with it a basic knowledge of the command line, etc. I'm treating this as
        a podcast about being new to *Rust*, not new to *programming*. If you're
        interested in a show more about being new to programming in general,
        they're out there---and specifically, you can listen to Sap.py, the
        podcast I do with my wife as she's learning Python! On this, show,
        however, the focus is on Rust.

      + Today: you'll hear a little bit about me, then a lot about Rust!

  - Me (3 minutes)
      + Software
          * modeling networks of neurons in the brain, avionics, hazards
            modeling, web development
          * Fortran, C, maintained some awful C++, Python
          * Web: PHP, Node.js, Angular, SQL, and of course lots of HTML, CSS,
            plain old JavaScript, SASS, etc.
      + Seminary "Master of Divinity, which is a *hilarious* title"

  - Rust
      + What is it? (6 minutes)
          * Systems programming language
          * Memory safe. Really. No segfaults in safe code. And the vast
            majority of Rust code is safe code (e.g. Cargo: all safe!).
          * High-level design (inferred types, functional programming, generics,
            traits, metaprogramming via hygienic macros)---it's a descendant of
            ML (like OCaml or F♯), and it shows.
          * > To put it simply: it’s low-level in its ability to address the 
            > computer, and high-level in the abstractions it hands to a
            > programmer.

      + What *isn't* it? (3 minutes)
          * A particularly beginner-friendly language. You *could*
            learn it as your first language, but I wouldn't necessarily
            recommend it. The language itself is relatively demanding, and the
            documentation is, too. It's possible, but I'd start with Python,
            Ruby, or JavaScript instead.
          * As of *today*, it isn't a classical "object oriented" language in
            the way that people tend to think of those things (i.e. in Java,
            C++, or C♯). It can *do* most of the same things, but it tackles
            the problems that inheritance is meant to solve in different ways.
            That said, inheritance is in the pipes: having more tools is good!

      + Why do I care? (3 minutes)
          * Time hunting bugs caused by memory leaks. Lots of it.
          * Writing in Python, etc.: integrating with Rust for performant code
            instead of C sounds *awesome*.
          * Performant, cross-platform back end for software I want to write
          * I just *like* it.
      + Why should *you* care? Well, all of the above reasons. If that hasn't
        persuaded you... just try it and see what you think! I find it a really
        *fun* language.
