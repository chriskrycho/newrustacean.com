# Bonus: Burnout

Hello, I’m Chris Krycho and this is New Rustacean: a show about the Rust Programming Language and the people who use it. This is a bonus episode, on *burnout*.

For today’s episode, I’m going to do something slightly different than usual. All the sponsors and show notes stuff will be up front in the next two minutes. After that, I’m going to talk about burnout and my experience of it—but there’s no script today. My *hope* is that hearing me talk about it, and talk about it “off script,” will help someone out there.

So: let’s talk sponsors.

## Sponsor: Parity Technologies

First, Parity Technologies is sponsoring this week’s episode because they want to hire you! Parity is advancing the state of the art in decentralized technology. Their flagship software is the Parity Ethereum client, but they're also building cutting-edge tech in areas like WebAssembly and peer-to-peer networking. Their next big project is Polkadot, a platform leveraging blockchain tech for scaling and interop in decentralized systems. Parity uses Rust for its trifecta of safety, speed, and correctness! If that sounds interesting, check out their jobs at paritytech.io/jobs.

Thanks again to Parity!

Okay, so let’s talk about burnout.

- what it isn’t
- what it is
	- Mayo clinic guidelines:
		- Have you become cynical or critical at work?
		- Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started once you arrive?
		- Have you become irritable or impatient with co-workers, customers or clients?
		- Do you lack the energy to be consistently productive?
		- Do you lack satisfaction from your achievements?
		- Do you feel disillusioned about your job?
		- Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to simply not feel?
		- Have your sleep habits or appetite changed?
		- Are you troubled by unexplained headaches, backaches or other physical complaints?

		Mayo calls it:  

		> a special type of job stress

		But the triggers aren’t just *job*-related

		Job-related causes Mayo suggests:

		- Lack of control.
		- Unclear job expectations.
		- Dysfunctional workplace dynamics.
		- Mismatch in values.
		- Poor job fit.
		- Extremes of activity.
		- Lack of social support.
		- Work-life imbalance.

		I add:

		- long-term stresses in family life, e.g. your dad gets a brain tumor or you’re a caregiver for someone
		- specific triggers can take “I’m stressed” -\> “burnout”

- it gets worse if you don’t deal with it
- how do you deal with it?
	- sleep
	- don’t overwork
	- friends
	- exercise
	- counselors! meds!
