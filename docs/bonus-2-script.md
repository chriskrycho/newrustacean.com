Legacy Code
===========

Intro (15s)
-----
Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 minute
show about learning the Rust programming language. This is **Bonus Episode 2:
Legacy Code**


Talk (6-8m)
----

  - Talking with a colleague about changes we're making to a codebase right now.
  - History: all but one major job or contract == maintenance.
  - The problem: a lot of times, legacy code is a mess.
  - The temptation: FIX ALL THE THINGS!!!
  - The other problem: stuff (usually, for the most part) actually works now
  - The solution: clean up your mess as you go. Be a good Boy Scout.
