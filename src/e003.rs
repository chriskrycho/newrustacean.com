//! # Notes
//!
//! Today's episode discusses, in order:
//!
//!   - Enumerated types, with an eye to the difference between structs and
//!     enums, and to the differences between `enum`s in C and in Rust.
//!   - Pattern matching, with a focus on using them with enumerated types and
//!     some discussion about how they differ from `switch` blocks in C-like
//!     languages.
//!   - Using the `Option` and `Result` enumerated types with pattern matching
//!     to provide meaningful returns from functions safely.
//!
//! ## Order
//! There is a specific order to the examples below, and it is *not* the
//! automatically-alphabetized order rendered by `rustdoc`. Instead, you should
//! work through in the sequence they appear in the [source]:
