//! Notes
//! -----
//!
//! Rust is an *expression-oriented* language. What does that mean, and how does
//! it play out in Rust? We look at `if` and `match` blocks, discuss looping
//! constructs, and examine functions, and then widen out to discuss how having
//! an expression-oriented language can change the way we think about
//! programming.

///
/// Note that we can see several things going on in the body of this function:
///
/// 1. The items within the function are expressions.
/// 2. The function *returns* the value of the final expression in the function
///    body. But a better way to think about it is to see the function as having
///    that value *itself*, because...
/// 3. The function itself *is* an expression, which is evaluated to have the
