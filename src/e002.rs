//! # Notes
//!
//! Today's episode discusses, and the associated source code demonstrates,
//! a few basic behaviors of structs... including borrowing!
//!
//! After taking a short look at one of Rust's basic approaches to creating new
//! types, we dive into a *fairly* thorough overview of how borrowing works in
//! fairly run-of-the-mill Rust code. This is a basic introduction, and as such
//! I'm not getting into things like heap-allocated memory (`Box`) or dealing
//! with `move` semantics with threads or closures. (I haven't actually figured
//! those out well enough yet to write something like this for them!)
//!
//! As usual, you'll want to have the [`src`] open to see what I'm doing with
//! the components documented below.
