//! Notes
//! -----
//!
//! Chris chats with Sean Griffin about the tradeoffs between mental overhead
//! and type safety, the expressiveness of different type systems, and some of
//! the places where Rust currently falls down.
//!
//!
//! ### Corrigenda
//!
//! Sean noted he could be wrong about `IEnumerable<T>` not having a `Sum`
//! method in C♯, and post-show research indicated that he was (it's possible it
//! was added after he had stopped doing .NET work, of course). See the
//! [documentation][c1] for details on how `IEnumerable<T>.Sum` it behaves in C♯
//! if you're curious.
//!
//! As a related note, I (Chris) have done a little bit of digging on C♯ in the
//! interval and it's fair to say that while a lot of the "ceremony" involved in
//! writing C♯ is annoying, it's much more than just a "slightly nicer Java",
//! and indeed is a much nicer language than my previous, limited exposure had
//! led me to believe. It's no Rust or F♯, but its type system is substantially
//! more capable than Java's.
