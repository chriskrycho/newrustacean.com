//! Notes
//! -----
//!
//! Talking about type systems! A broad and wide-ranging discussion about type
//! systems in general, with specific examples from languages like PHP,
//! JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Java, C♯, Haskell, and Rust!
//!
//!   - What is a type system?
//!   - What are the kinds of things we get out of type systems?
//!   - What are the tradeoffs with different type systems?
//!   - What is Rust's type system like?
//!   - What is especially attractive about Rust's type system?
//!
//! A comment on the C integer/character string addition example: what's
//! actually happening there is that the character string is an array "under the
//! covers," and as such has an address. C silently switches to using the memory
//! address, which is of course just an integer, when you try to add the two
//! together. As I said on the show: the result is nonsense (unless you're using
//! this as a way of operating on memory addresses), but it's compileable
//! nonsense. In a stricter and stronger type system, memory addresses and
//! normal numbers shouldn't be addable!
