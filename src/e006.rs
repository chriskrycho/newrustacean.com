//! # Notes
//!
//! Today, we are talking about modules, packages, and APIs in Rust. Taking a
//! bit of a breather after some pretty hard material the last few weeks.
//!
//! For reference, the [Rust book][notes-1] section on [Crates and
//! Modules][notes-2] will be very helpful.
//!

//!
//! ## Corrigenda
//!
//! I accidentally called this episode 5, instead of episode 6. *Whoops.*
//!
//! Just before the 15:00 mark, while discussing libraries, I referred to
//! "e006.md" when I meant to say "e006.rs". Slips of the tongue inspired by the
//! fact that Rust (delightfully) uses Markdown for its documentation.

//! # Module Docs!
//!
//! As you've no doubt noted if you've actually looked at the show notes along
//! the way, these are in fact module docs! Because we're inside a module marked
//! off by being a file, we *have* to use the `//!` style of documentation
//! comments to mark them off. However, as you'll see below, if we structure or
//! declare modules in other ways, we will not have the same restriction.
