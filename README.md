This is a *slightly crazy* approach to building a podcast hosting setup using
Rust's documentation tools, for the [New Rustacean] podcast. I'm making the
site source publicly available so that others can follow along and learn from
my successes, failures, and various misadventures along the way. Feel free to
submit pull requests if you find typos or the like!

I hope to evolve the structure here based on what will hopefully *become* the
structure for sites generated with `cargo doc` in the future, with
supplementary/guide-like material living in the `src/doc` directory. For an
example of existing repositories which use this structure, see [rust-lang/rust]
and [rust-lang/cargo].
